 ORGANIZING YOUR SOLUTION
 
 A good way to orgaize your code is to separate your code into the three sections - input, process, output – as much as possible.
 
 The start of a solution is implemented below. Consider all the possible inputs. Can you finish the solution?

/*
 
 INPUT
 
 Be sure that your implementation of this section discards all the possible bad inputs the user could provide.
 
 Make use of your test plan and algorithm to ensure your code is complete.

 PROCESS
 
 Here is where you implement the logic that solves the problem at hand.
 
 Make use of your test plan and algorithm to ensure your code is complete.

 OUTPUT
 
 Here is where you report the results of the 'process' section above.
